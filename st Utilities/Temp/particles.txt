particle system - object that emits particles, can be 2d or 3d
particle effect - combination of one or many particles systems to create a graphic effect
any object can have a particle system
controls in lower right
animates when selected -
	can nest to combine/animate both
in editor
	each row is a module
		show all modules in submenu of particle system to simplify
		drop downs on right of rows lets you change values over time	
			random
			curve
				keyframes
	open editor... opens particle system editor
		can be docked
		can put multiple particle emitters in one particle
	PARTICLE SYSTEM
		duration - duration of looping emission or if not looping duration of looping
		prewarm - start with particles already out there
		start delay - wait this long before emitting
		start lifetime - the basic lifetime of each particle
		start speed - basic speed of each particle
		start size - how big is each particle
		start rotation - 
		start color -
		gravity multiplier - how much of world's gravity is applied.
		inherit velocity - how much velocity of object is given to particles
		simulation space - effect of object's parent space
		play on wake - start when scene is played?
		max particles - max # of particles that can be active
	EMISSION
		rate - particles per second
			over distance - emit particles as system moves... more the more it moves
			time - allows bursts in addition to rate
	SHAPE
		shape of emitter
		mesh only works with 3d object
	COLOR BY SPEED
		speed of particle
